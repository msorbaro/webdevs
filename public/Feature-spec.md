## Synopsis of Idea

Describe what you want to build!
	The Webdevs will be building a stock market discussion board! There's a lot of amateur stock pickers out there who could benefit from hearing where others thinking the market will go and why so that they can build a better understanding and make better predictions. We plan to pick a few of the major stocks to start and provide the daily stock charts along with discussion boards underneath where users can put whether they are bullish or bearish on the stock for the week and why.
